# GST-API-Sample
Sample console project that shows how to use Risersoft (www.risersoft.com) GSTN API Library, which is a closed source strongly typed client for GSTN APIs as per http://developer.gstsystem.co.in/apiportal/

This is more up-to-date library and used in products such as Maximprise manufacturing ERP (www.maximprise.com) and GstNirvana Gst Filing App (www.gstnirvana.com).
We intend to periodically publish the library and update the console project to keep up with GSTN changes.

The structure is very similar to the open source version at https://github.com/Risersoft/GSTN, so you will right at home if you have been using that project.

Releasing the compiled library also means that you don't need to worry about maintaining the source code.

Usage:

    GSTN is constantly evolving the APIs.
    Use Nuget Package directly in your project
    This will enable easy updation in case of change

Attractions:
    
    Production ready fully tested API
    FILEDET and RETSTATUS implemented
    Single Function for multiple sections

Nuget Package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Risersoft.GSTN.API.Library/
